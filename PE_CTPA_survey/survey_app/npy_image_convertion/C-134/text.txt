The liver has a regular shape. The right lobe oblique diameter is 100 mm. The hepatic parenchyma shows evenly distributed echogenic points. The intrahepatic vascular system is clear. The portal vein diameter is widened to approximately 10 mm, and the common bile duct diameter is widened to approximately 4 mm.
The gallbladder has a normal shape. The wall is rough, with a thickness of about 2 mm. Multiple hyperechoic masses with posterior acoustic shadows are visible inside, which can move with changes in body position, with the largest area measuring about 31Ã—8 mm.
The pancreas has a regular shape. The head is about 17 mm thick, and the body is about 12 mm thick. The pancreatic parenchyma has uniform echogenicity. No obvious dilation of the main pancreatic duct is seen.
The spleen has a regular shape with uniform echogenicity in the parenchyma. The spleen is about 31 mm thick and not palpable below the costal margin. The splenic vein has a normal course and diameter.
Both kidneys have regular shapes and normal sizes. The renal parenchyma has uniform echogenicity. No obvious hydronephrosis or hyperechoic masses are detected within the renal collecting systems.
No significant dilation is observed in the bilateral ureters.
CDFI: The portal vein shows adequate blood flow signals with a Vmax of 18 cm/s. The blood flow distribution in the examined areas is acceptable, with no obvious abnormal blood flow signals detected.
