Liver:
Regular shape. The oblique diameter of the right lobe of the liver is 130 mm.
Multiple slightly higher echogenic nodules are visible within the liver, with clear boundaries and regular shapes. The largest one measures approximately 14×12 mm.
Multiple cystic hypoechoic areas are also detected, with clear boundaries and good acoustic transmission inside. The largest cyst measures about 47×40 mm.
Multiple echogenic foci without obvious acoustic shadows are visible within the liver, with the largest one measuring about 12×9 mm.
The remaining liver parenchyma shows evenly distributed echogenic dots. The intrahepatic duct system is clear.
The diameter of the portal vein is about 10 mm, and the diameter of the common bile duct is about 4 mm.
Gallbladder:
Full shape with a size of approximately 90×40 mm.
The wall is thickened to about 5 mm and rough. Fine echogenic debris is visible inside.
A slightly higher echogenic mass attached to the gallbladder wall, measuring about 7×5 mm, is observed and does not move with changes in body position.
Pancreas:
Regular shape. The head of the pancreas is about 18 mm thick, and the body is about 12 mm thick. The tail is not clearly visualized.
The pancreatic parenchyma shows uniform echogenicity. No obvious dilatation of the main pancreatic duct is detected.
Spleen:
Regular shape with uniform echogenicity of the splenic parenchyma.
The splenic thickness is about 28 mm, and it is not palpable below the costal margin.
The splenic vein has a normal course and diameter.
CDFI (Color Doppler Flow Imaging):
Adequate blood flow filling in the portal vein.
The slightly higher echogenic nodules within the liver do not show obvious blood flow signals.
Normal blood flow distribution in the examined areas. No obvious abnormal blood flow signals are detected.
