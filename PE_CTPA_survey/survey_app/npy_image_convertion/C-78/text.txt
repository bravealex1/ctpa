Liver: The liver appears full in shape with a smooth surface. The right liver oblique diameter measures approximately 130 mm. The parenchyma shows fine and dense echogenic spots, with near-field echo enhancement and far-field echo attenuation. The intrahepatic ductal system is poorly visualized. The portal vein measures approximately 10 mm in diameter, and the upper segment of the common bile duct measures approximately 5 mm in diameter, while the middle and lower segments are not clearly visualized.

Gallbladder: The gallbladder has a normal shape and size. The wall appears thickened and irregular. A hyperechoic focus measuring approximately 12Ã—9 mm with posterior acoustic shadowing is seen within the gallbladder, which is mobile with changes in patient position.

Pancreas: The pancreas has a regular shape and normal size. The parenchyma demonstrates uniform echogenicity, and no significant dilation of the main pancreatic duct is observed.

Spleen: The spleen has a regular shape with homogeneous echogenicity. The spleen measures approximately 30 mm in thickness and is not palpable below the costal margin. The splenic vein course and diameter are normal.

Kidneys: Both kidneys have a regular shape and normal size. The parenchyma demonstrates uniform echogenicity, and no obvious fluid-filled anechoic areas or hyperechoic foci are observed in the collecting system.

Ureters: No obvious dilation is observed in the bilateral ureters.

CDFI (Color Doppler Flow Imaging): Blood flow in the portal vein is adequately visualized, with a maximum velocity (Vmax) of 18 cm/s. Blood flow distribution in the examined areas is normal, with no significant abnormal blood flow signals detected.
